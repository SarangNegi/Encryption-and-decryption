# Encryption-and-decryption

Encryption: This is the process of converting plain text (readable data) into cipher text (unreadable data) using an algorithm and an encryption key. The purpose is to ensure data privacy and protect it from unauthorized access. Only authorized parties with the correct decryption key can convert the cipher text back into readable plain text.

Decryption: This is the reverse process of encryption, where cipher text is converted back into plain text. It requires the use of a decryption key, which is often the same as the encryption key (for symmetric encryption) or a different one (for asymmetric encryption).
